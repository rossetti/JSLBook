The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of the Java Simulation Library (JSL). The JSL facilitates simulation modeling by providing Java libraries that ease the development of simulation models. The JSL has packages for random variable generation, statistical analysis, event calendar management, and other common constructs that are needed when performing Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation modeling.
